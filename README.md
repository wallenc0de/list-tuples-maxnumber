# lists and tuples
It has nothing really fancy in it, it is only my first repo where im just explaining tuples and lists in a function.

**Tuples and Lists**
In Python a `list` is used to store multiple pieces of informations, `tuples` are a type of data structure just like `lists` it can store different values, but it has a few key differences - one of the things that makes `tuples` unique is that they are immutable.
When we talk about something being immutable means that you can't change it, erase it, modify it etc.

`Tuples` is used a lot when you need to store pieces of data that don't need to be modified.
