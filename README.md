# lists and tuples
It has nothing really fancy in it, it is only my first repo where im just explaining tuples and lists in a function.

**Tuples and Lists**
Generally speaking, `tuples` and `lists` are the same but a little different.
In Python a `list` is used to store multiple pieces of informations.
Now, `tuples` are a type of data structure just like `lists` it can store different values, but it has a few key differences, one of the things that makes `tuples` unique, is that they are immutable.

When we talk about something being immutable means that you can't change it, erase it, modify it etc.
