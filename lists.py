"""
This is just an example program using 'if statements' with operators and comparing them with strings and integers.

Tuples and lists are basically the same thing they are both containers that store different pieces of informations.
However there's a few key differences that makes tuples unique to lists, just as strings and numbers they are immutable.
once you create a tuple it does it as it is.

I personally would use tuples in data where i would not change or modify them.
